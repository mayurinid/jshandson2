        Question 1. Calculator
        Write a program to make a simple calculator using switch statement that takes operator and two numbers from user and print the result after operation.
        Answer 1. 
        const Calculator = (A, B, C) => 
        {
            switch(A) {
              case "+": return B+C;
              case "-": return B-C;
              case "*": return B*C;
              case "/": return B/C;
              default: return 0;
            }          
        };
        Question 2.Check whether the condition is fulfilled or not?
        Write a program that takes a number and prints whether the number is divisible by 
        6 and  9 or not.
        Answer 2.const Check_divisibility = (N) => {
            if(N%6==0 && N%9==0)
            {
              return "Divisible by both";
            }else
            {
               return "Not Divisible by both";
            }
            };
        Question 3. Eligible Voter
        You are given an integer A, denoting the age of a person, and your task is to determine whether he/she is eligible to vote or not.
        Answer 3. const isEligible = (a) => {
            if (a>=18 && a<=120) 
            {
              return "Eligible for Voting";
            } else
            {
              return " Not Eligible for Voting";
            }
            };
          Question 4. PrepBuddy wants you to get familiar with various Relational operators. He provides you with two integer values 
          X and Y and asks you to find the relation between them.
          The relationships between integers 
          X and Y are as follows:
          If X< Y , it means that 
          X is smaller than Y .
          If X > Y, it means that 
          X is greater than Y.
          If X=Y, it means that 
          X is equal to Y.
          Answer 4.const findRelation = (x,y) => {
            if(x<y){
              return x + " is smaller than " + y;
            }
            else if(x>y){
              return x + " is greater than " +  y;
            }
            else {
              return x + " is equal to " + y;
            }
            };                  
            Question 5.Find Grades
            Your school has the following grading system based upon the marks(M) obtained by a student:
            If M ≤ 10, the grade will be E.
            If 11 ≥ M ≤ 20, the grade will be D.
            If 21 ≥ M  ≤ 30, the grade will be C.
            If 31 ≥ M ≤ 40, the grade will be B.
            If 41 ≥ M ≤ 50, the grade will be A.
            Your friend will enter his marks out of 50, and your task is to print his grades using a switch statement.
            Answer 5. 
            const findGrades = (a) => {
                if(a<=10){
                  return "E";
                }
                  else {
                        if (a >= 11 && a <=20) 
                        {
                             return 'D';
                        }
                        else
                        {
                            if (a >= 21 && a <=30) 
                            {
                                 return 'C';
                            }
                            else
                            {
                                if (a >= 31 && a <=40) 
                                {
                                     return  'B';
                                }
                                else (a >= 41 && a <=50)
                                {
                                    return  'A';
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
            };

    else{
      return(z);

Write a program takes takes three angles and checks whether the triangle is acute or obtuse.
Answer 9.
const Triangle_Check = (A,B,C) => {
  let angle = A+B+C;
    if(angle == 180 && A > 0 && B > 0 && C > 0) 
    {
       if (A < 90 && B < 90 && C < 90) 
       {
         return "acute";
       }
       else if (A == 90 || B == 90 || C == 90)
       {
         return "right";
       }
